Contribution Guidelines
=======================
Great to have you here. Here are a few ways you can help make our project better!

# Expectations Before Contribution

## Adding Functionality

* If you would like to have new feature added, open an issue to have a discussion started. If there is sufficient interested, this issue is turned into a feature request and anyone is free contribute an implementation.
* If you would like to implement a requested feature, fork this repository, and send us a pull request referenecing the issue tracking this feature request.

## Bug Triage

How to request and fix bugs:

* You can report bugs as issues for the project, give as much detail as possible. Logs, stacktraces, versions...etc.
* You can look through the existing bugs/issues in the project and contribute.
* Look at existing bugs and help us understand if:
  * The bug is reproducible?
  * Is it reproducible in other environments (browsers)?
  * What are the steps to reproduce?
  * You can close fixed bugs by testing old tickets to see if they are happening

# Process for Contributing Code

To work on a bug fix or a feature request

1. Claim the issue by putting a comment stating you intent to start work on it
2. Fork this repository
3. Implement in your forked copy
4. Send a pull request for review


# Code Quality Expectations

Before you submit a pull request

* Follow the coding style
* Run your files through [JSHint](http://jshint.com)
* All new methods should have correlated unit tests
* Keep code coverage **above 75%**
* Code should be well documented. What it is doing should be self explanatory based on coding conventions, however why the code is doing something should be documented well.

# SLA

1. Pull requests are usually reviewed within a few days.  
1. If there are comments to address, apply your changes in a separate commit and push that to your feature branch.  
1. Post a comment in the pull request afterwards; GitHub does not send out notifications when you add commits.
